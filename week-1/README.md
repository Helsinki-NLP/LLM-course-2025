# Introduction to Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLM)

Week 1 is the most theory-heavy week of the course. You can find the lecture slides here: [Week 1 Slides](https://github.com/Helsinki-NLP/LLM-course-2024/blob/main/week-1/LLM-Course%20Lecture%201.pdf).

Recording: [week-1/lecture_1.mp4](lecture_1.mp4)

## Lab Assignment

Research on Tokenizers and write a section to your final report reflecting on the following questions:
* What are tokenizers?
* Why are they important for language modeling and LLMs?
* What different tokenization algorithms are there and which ones are the most popular ones and why?
